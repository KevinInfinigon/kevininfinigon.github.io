                        <b>About Me: </b>
                        My name is Jiahe Liu and I am currently a master's student majored in Electrical Engineering at Northwestern. 
                        I would like to pursue a specialization of Signal Processing and Machine Learning, and I am currently looking 
                        for opportunities to accumulate more hands-on experience.
                        <br>
                        <b>About My Past: </b>
                        Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from Wuhan University with a major in Physics. Physics is complicated 
                        but fun, and it helped me establish a solid mathematical background for further studies in the relevant fields. I 
                        became interested in Signal Processing halfway through my bachelor's study, so I built relevant backgrounds and 
                        decided to take a further step into this field after graduation.
                        <br>
                        <b>About More: </b>
                        I was born in a coastal city named Dalian, in the Liaoning province of China. Our family moved to Beijing when I 
                        was 9 years' old, and then to London when I was 10. We returned to Beijing after a year and a half and lived there 
                        since then. I enjoy playing the piano and the guitar, as well as table-tennis and badminton.
